# Flexible-Multipurpose-Cryptographic-System-on-FPGA
Design and Implementation of a multipurpose cryptographic accelerator in VHDL
For detailed information, read our [publication](https://ijeces.ferit.hr/index.php/ijeces/article/view/1445)

**The proposed design is a GALS architecture (Globally asynchronous locally synchronous) featuring :**
* a Tunable Keccak Core
* High Speed Fully Pipelined 128-bit AES Core operating in CTR mode
* ADC Controller

**The core system can perform:**
* Block Cipher Symmetric Encryption (128-bits)
* All SHA-3 Variants
* Pseudo-random Number Number Generator with tunable Security/performance ratio
* Post-processing Unit for True Random Number Generation
* Key Derivation Function
